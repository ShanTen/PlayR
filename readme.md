The UI is stolen from [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-music-player-using-javascript/)

I really only made the sever side along with a few tweaks to how data was processed on the client

> Note: this project was made in 3 hours by a partially sleep depraved (not a spelling error) individual

For Usage:
    * Go to ~/serber 
    * Edit `config.json` with your music directory location 
    * npm install
    * run server with `node server.js`
    * Open View.html

Use at your own risk.
